Amazon, YouTube, and Facebook are all examples of sites that suggest potential items (e.g., products, videos, etc.) of interest to users based on their previous activity on the site. This can be handy for users, but also very important for businesses.  \n",

On the other hand, if the two users always tend to disagree about books, then `user_b` is unlikely to read a book that `user_a` recommends. \n",

The linearithmic time comes from the 'resolve_tie' function, which uses the sorted() function on a list of users with the same similarity scores. Although it is unlikely that everyone would share the same similarity score, the worst case is O(nlogn).\n",
