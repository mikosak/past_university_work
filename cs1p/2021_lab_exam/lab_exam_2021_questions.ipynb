    "* We have a sequence of records (called \"blocks\"), where each block includes the hash of the previous record as well as the current record (the \"chain links\"). \n",

    "## Problems with blockchains\n",
    "We've implemented (part) of a very simple blockchain. You will hear a lot about blockchains, crypto, NFTs and related concepts. There are issues with these technologies you should understand. I've provided this summary as it is important to put these ideas in context; however, I would urge you to do your own background research and think critically about what is said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are not synonymous, though cryptocurrencies are the most prominent use of blockchains. Blockchains underpin other processes; version control systems like `git` are akin to blockchains. All of these are ultimately based on the idea of a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), which is the data structure that you have implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security and technical\n",
    "\n",
    "We have only implemented part of a blockchain, and a very simple one at that. Importantly, we have not addressed ways of proving ownership, and (in the context of cryptocurrency) solving the problem of being able to create \"money from nothing\" (or the \"double spending problem\"). This would usually involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cryptographic signatures** to sign blocks, so that someone can prove that they are the one who made an entry (and thus prove ownership).\n",
    "* A **consensus mechanism** to allow a consistent blockchain history to be constructed without the involvement a central authority.\n",
    "* **Proof-of-work** which is used to make it hard to fake blocks by requiring (enormous) computational effort to add new blocks to the chain. Other proof schemes exist, but most current cryptocurrencies primarily use proof-of-work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to understand how a full cryptocurrency works in more detail, watch [the 3blue1brown video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental\n",
    "Because many actively-used blockchains (e.g. in cryptocurrencies) use proof-of-work, there is a huge computational burden to making transactions on a blockchain. The proof-of-work requires truly mind-boggling amounts of electricity to do these computations (not to mention GPUs and other computer hardware), all of which *do nothing* -- they literally prove that someone has wasted enough computation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin transactions  [consume more electrical power than the whole of Finland at the time of writing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html#:~:text=But%20first%2C%20consider%20this%3A%20The,nation%20of%20about%205.5%20million.). This has an extraordinary cost in terms of environmental impact, as it typically requires burning fossil fuels to do the (wasted) computations to prove ownership. It is possible that such schemes will be regulated out of existence by states (e.g. Bitcoin is banned in China and several other states; Sweden is proposing an EU-wide ban). \n",
    "\n",
    "Other blockchains may be more environmentally friendly, but they have not yet become dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scams\n",
    "**Most cryptocurrencies are either outright scams or are a front for money laundering.** There are, or could be, legitimate uses for financial transactions based on blockchains, and there is clearly appetite for decentralised systems to move funds. But most people promoting \"crypto\" are trying to get rich quick, either by speculating (legal but risky), by undermining the rule of law by trading contraband or trading in illegal ways (e.g. selling drugs, evading taxes), or by organising pump and dump schemes (a standard, and illegal, con). There is no free money. There is a lot of money in tricking stupid people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have an inherently deflationary structure -- it gets harder to \"mine\" (do proof-of-work to validate transactions) as time goes on, so it is easy to build up ownership of \"coins\" at the launch of a cryptocurrency than later. This rewards early adopters in a way that is reminiscent of a pyramid scheme, and occasionally is explicitly a pyramid scheme. Even if not, deflationary currencies incentivise investors to hold onto their investments and not spend it on economic activity; a potentially problematic structure for efficient economies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NFTs\n",
    "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are used to confer a form of \"ownership\" over artworks have become very popular. These essential issue \"receipts\" to \"owners\" and store the receipts on the blockchain, so that someone can prove they \"own\" an artwork. No actual legal change of ownership of the artwork (e.g. copyright) is usually involved. These are extremely controversial. They have provided much-needed income to artists who otherwise have few ways of monetising digital content. However, many NFT schemes are a transparent con game. No real ownership exists or is transferred -- just a link to a database that belongs to a third party company. Prices are artificially inflated by illegal market manipulation. If someone tells you the future is NFTs, or `web3`, treat them with great scepticism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Irrevocability \n",
    "Blockchains provide a way to establish a distributed, verifiable history. By their nature, they cannot be modified once established; the chain will no longer verify. History on the blockchain is permanent. This can be good (e.g. if you want to record election results that cannot be tampered with, or property transaction records) but also bad (e.g. if you incorrectly record a criminal conviction). Various legal frameworks, such as the GDPR, require that individuals be able to permanently delete, or correct, data recorded about them. Most blockchains inherently cannot comply with these requirements, and so in many cases identifiable personal data could not legally be stored on a blockchain. \n"
