The Core architecture of Sigma16 consists of a small set of
instructions that are flexible enough for a wide range of practical
programming.

- [[./Simple/index.org][Simple]] Small and simple programs.  These
  examples are a good starting point. testing using index.org

- [[./Arithmetic/index.org][Arithmetic]] Demonstrate the arithmetic
  operations.

- [[./Control/index.html][Control]] Flow of control: jumping and
  conditionals

- [[./Arrays/index.org][Arrays]] Programs that define arrays, index
  elements, and traverse arrays.

- [[./IO/index.org][Input/Output]] Use trap instructions to read
  input and write output.

- [[./Sorting/index.org][Sorting]] Sorting the elements of an array.

- [[./Subroutines/index.org][Subroutines]] Basic procedures and
  functions with simple calling conventions.

- [[./Instructions/index.org][Instructions]] 

- [[./Testing/index.org][Testing]]
